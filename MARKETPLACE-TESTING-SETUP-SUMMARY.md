# Marketplace Testing Setup Summary

## Current Status

We've identified and fixed several issues with the marketplace functionality:

- ✅ All required database tables exist (`seller_profiles`, `listings`, `listing_images`, `seller_orders`) 
- ✅ Fixed column names in `seller_profiles` table (renamed `shop_name` to `store_name` when needed)
- ✅ Updated `marketplaceService.ts` to use the correct join syntax for relationships
- ✅ Created SQL scripts for schema fixes and test data creation

## Manual Steps Required

To complete the marketplace setup and enable testing, you need to perform the following steps manually in the Supabase dashboard:

### 1. Apply Schema Fixes

1. Log in to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the contents of `marketplace-schema-fix-final.sql` file
5. Run the SQL script

This will:
- Add any missing columns in the `seller_profiles` table
- Create the `listing_images` and `seller_orders` tables if they don't exist
- Add the crucial foreign key relationship between `listings.seller_id` and `seller_profiles.user_id`
- Add necessary indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Create Test Data

1. Remain in the Supabase SQL Editor
2. Create another new query
3. Copy and paste the contents of `create-test-data-import.sql` file
4. Run the SQL script

This will:
- Create a test seller profile with ID `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`
- Create three test listings for random products with different conditions
- Add test listing images

### 3. Verify Setup

After completing the above steps, run the following command to verify everything is set up correctly:

```bash
node verify-marketplace-schema.js
```

You should see that all tables exist and test data has been created.

## Technical Notes

### Foreign Key Relationship Issue

The primary issue was that Supabase couldn't find a relationship between the `listings` and `seller_profiles` tables. This is because the `seller_profiles` table uses `user_id` as its primary key, not `id`.

We fixed this by:
1. Adding an explicit foreign key constraint from `listings.seller_id` to `seller_profiles.user_id`
2. Updating the `marketplaceService.ts` queries to use the correct join syntax:

```typescript
// Old (doesn't work):
seller:seller_id(user_id, store_name, is_verified, average_rating)

// New (works):
seller_profiles!seller_id(user_id, store_name, is_verified, average_rating)
```

### Row-Level Security (RLS) Policy Issue

When testing, we encountered RLS policy issues when trying to insert or update data. To work around this:

1. We run the SQL scripts directly in the Supabase SQL Editor, which bypasses RLS policies
2. We modified the service to add backward compatibility by mapping `seller_profiles` to `seller` in the returned data

## Performance Optimizations

We've also created a script with performance optimizations:

```bash
# After completing the above steps, run these optimizations:
# Use the Supabase SQL Editor to run:
marketplace-performance-optimizations.sql
```

These optimizations add indexes to frequently queried columns to improve query performance.

## Next Steps

After completing the setup:

1. Run the application to test the marketplace functionality
2. Check for any browser console errors
3. Test the multi-seller checkout flow
4. Test the seller dashboard functionality
