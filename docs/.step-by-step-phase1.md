Below is a **very detailed, step-by-step plan** specifically for **Phase 1 (Frontend Setup with Next.js)**. Each task is accompanied by checkboxes so that you can track the progress with your developer. The objective of this phase is to establish the foundational front-end structure, replicate/improve upon the existing site's design, and prepare for future integrations. 

---

## Phase 1: Frontend Setup with Next.js

### 1. **Project Initialization & Configuration**

- [✓] **1.1** Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket named, for example, `theshoprecords-frontend`.
- [✓] **1.2** Clone the repository locally:  
  ```bash
  git clone <repo-url>
  cd theshoprecords-frontend
  ```
- [✓] **1.3** Run `npx create-next-app@latest .` to initialize a new Next.js app **within** that directory. 
  - Choose **TypeScript** if desired (recommended for better type-safety).
  - Or select the JavaScript option if you prefer.
  - Confirm the folder is named appropriately (e.g., the existing `.`).
- [✓] **1.4** Confirm the base Next.js structure: a `pages` folder (or `app` folder if using Next.js App Router), and config files like `next.config.js`.
- [✓] **1.5** Install additional dependencies:
  - **UI libraries** (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, or Styled Components). For Tailwind, run:
    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
  - Any other optional dependencies you plan to use for styling or icons (e.g., `@heroicons/react` if you like those icons).
  - Installed Supabase client (@supabase/supabase-js) for database integration.

### 2. **Basic Project Setup**

- [✓] **2.1** Configure global styles:
  - If using Tailwind, open `tailwind.config.js` and set up your theme (colors, fonts) as needed. 
  - In `globals.css` (or equivalent), import Tailwind's base, components, and utilities if using Tailwind:
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
- [✓] **2.2** Set up your **site-wide layout**:
  - Create a `components/layouts/MainLayout.tsx` (or `.jsx`) that includes:
    - Header (logo, navigation, search bar)
    - Main content area
    - Footer (copyright, links)
  - Import this layout in your main pages.
  - (If using App Router in Next.js 13, you can do this with a `layout.tsx` file in the `app` directory.)
- [✓] **2.3** Set up Supabase client:
  - Created a Supabase client configuration in utils/supabase.ts
  - Set up environment variables for Supabase URL and API key
  - Connected the client to the Supabase database

### 3. **Create Pages & Routes**

1. **3.1** **Home Page** (`/`)
   - [✓] **3.1.1** In `pages/index.tsx`, create a basic component with a placeholder hero section or "Featured Records" section.
   - [✓] **3.1.2** Add a simple placeholder "Featured Items" grid or carousel for demonstration.
   - [✓] **3.1.3** Wrap it in `MainLayout` so the page has the header and footer.
   - [✓] **3.1.4** Integrate with Supabase to fetch and display real product data.

2. **3.2** **Shop/Catalog Page** (`/shop`)
   - [✓] **3.2.1** Create `pages/shop/index.tsx`.
   - [✓] **3.2.2** Add a grid or list layout of product cards (using data from Supabase).
   - [✓] **3.2.3** Include pagination or infinite scroll structure if you want (just placeholders for the moment).
   - [✓] **3.2.4** Ensure a search bar or filter panel could be placed here in the future.

3. **3.3** **Product Detail Page** (`/shop/[id]`)
   - [✓] **3.3.1** Create `[id].tsx` or `[slug].tsx` inside `pages/shop`.
   - [✓] **3.3.2** Display a single product detail layout: large cover image, title, artist, price, add-to-cart button, etc.
   - [✓] **3.3.3** Fetch and display data from Supabase based on the product ID.

4. **3.4** **Cart Page** (`/cart`)
   - [✓] **3.4.1** Create `pages/cart.tsx`.
   - [✓] **3.4.2** Display a list of cart items (dummy array), showing product name, quantity, price, and a total price calculation.
   - [✓] **3.4.3** Include a placeholder "Checkout" button.

5. **3.5** **Auth Pages** (`/login`, `/register`) 
   - [✓] **3.5.1** Create `pages/login.tsx` and `pages/register.tsx` with simple forms. 
   - [✓] **3.5.2** No actual authentication yet (will connect to Supabase Auth in Phase 3), but have the forms structured: email/password fields, a submit button, etc.

6. **3.6** **User Dashboard (Placeholder)** (`/dashboard`)
   - [✓] **3.6.1** Create `pages/dashboard/index.tsx`.
   - [✓] **3.6.2** Protected route (we'll do actual protection in Phase 3), but for now just a placeholder "Welcome [User], here's your dashboard" message.

### 4. **Replicate & Improve Existing Design Elements**

- [✓] **4.1** **Header (Navigation & Search)**  
  - Make sure the layout closely resembles or improves the current site's header, including:
    - Logo on the left or center.
    - Navigation links (Home, Shop, Dashboard, etc.) or a hamburger menu for mobile.
    - A search bar either in the header or as an icon that expands. 
    - Possibly a cart icon showing cart count.

- [✓] **4.2** **Footer**  
  - Re-create or slightly improve the existing footer design:
    - Basic text about TheShopRecords.
    - Social media links or newsletter signup (if the current site has them).
    - Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy links, etc.

- [✓] **4.3** **Typography & Color Scheme**  
  - Ensure fonts and colors are consistent with your existing branding. If the current site uses a particular font, replicate or find a close match via Google Fonts/Typekit.
  - Set up utility classes (if using Tailwind) or theme tokens for brand colors, headings, body text, etc.

- [✓] **4.4** **Responsive Layout**  
  - Test the new layout on mobile sizes. Ensure:
    - Header items stack or collapse into a hamburger menu.
    - Product grids re-flow to 1 or 2 columns on small screens.
    - Cart page is scannable on small devices.
  - Keep checking the design so it feels user-friendly (like your current site) but with small enhancements.

### 5. **Implement Data Fetching & State Management**

- [✓] **5.1** **Supabase Integration for Products**  
  - Implemented Supabase client connection in utils/supabase.ts.
  - Created service functions in utils/productService.ts to fetch products from Supabase.
  - Created TypeScript interfaces that match the Supabase database schema.
  - Set up fetching real product data from Supabase database (145+ products).
- [✓] **5.2** **Cart State**  
  - Implement a simple React Context or a small state management approach (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or even use React's built-in Context + `useReducer`) to store the cart items.
  - For now, just have an "addToCart(productId)" that pushes the item to a `cartItems` array. 
  - Show the items on the Cart page. This is all local for now; no real backend yet.

### 6. **Navigation & Routing Verification**

- [✓] **6.1** Add a Next.js `<Link>` or a `useRouter` push for main links:
  - Header navigation links to Home (`/`), Shop (`/shop`), Cart (`/cart`).
  - Product card "View Details" linking to `/shop/[id]`.
- [✓] **6.2** Confirm each route works and the layout is consistent across pages.

### 7. **Styling & UI Polishing**

- [✓] **7.1** **Product Cards**  
  - Fine-tune the look of product cards: show cover image in a fixed ratio (like square), overlay or show price, short title, add to cart button, etc.
  - Make sure the card is consistent with the design language (colors, font sizes).
  - Enhanced product cards with clickable images and titles.
  - Added hover effects to improve UX and indicate interactivity.
  - Made "Add to Cart" button full-width with engaging hover animations.
- [✓] **7.2** **Buttons & Forms**  
  - Standardize button styles. Possibly create a `<Button>` component with variants (primary, secondary, etc.).
  - Style the login/register forms to match your brand.
- [✓] **7.3** **Hover & Focus States**  
  - Add subtle hover effects for links, product cards, buttons. 
  - Ensure accessibility for focus states (keyboard navigation).
  - Implemented sophisticated hover effects including:
    - Image zoom and overlay effects
    - Animated underlines for titles
    - Button scale, shadow, and overlay animations
- [✓] **7.4** **Images**  
  - Use Next.js `<Image>` component for images to leverage image optimization. 
  - For now, you can link to placeholder URLs or local static images to fill in. 
  - Check that images respond to different device sizes properly (responsive breakpoints).

### 8. **SEO & Meta Setup**

- [✓] **8.1** **Head Metadata**  
  - Use the `<Head>` component (or `next/head`) to set page titles and descriptions for Home, Shop, and Product pages. Even if they're placeholders, it's good practice.
- [✓] **8.2** **Basic SEO**  
  - Ensure the homepage has an `h1` with a descriptive heading like "TheShopRecords – Your Place for Vinyl." 
  - Add relevant meta tags (description, keywords, etc.) in `_document` or the individual page.
  - This will help once you go live, even if it's an MVP. 

### 9. **Set Up Version Control & CI/CD (Optional)**

- [✓] **9.1** **Git Commits**  
  - Throughout development, commit frequently with clear messages.
- [ ] **9.2** **Pull Requests & Code Reviews**  
  - If working in a team, ensure the developer creates feature branches and merges via PRs for tracking changes.
- [ ] **9.3** **Continuous Deployment**  
  - If you have a Vercel account or Netlify, connect the repo for automatic deployments. 
  - Every push to `main` or `master` can trigger a new staging build, providing a shareable URL to test the site's progress.
  - This will let you quickly preview the front-end changes.

### 10. **Testing & Final Checks for Phase 1**

- [✓] **10.1** **Browser Testing**  
  - Tested in Chrome through local development server.
  - Still need to test in other major browsers (Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- [✓] **10.2** **Mobile Responsiveness**  
  - Verified responsive layout works as expected at various breakpoints.
  - Product cards adjust properly on different screen sizes.
- [✓] **10.3** **Basic Accessibility**  
  - Ensured proper heading structure.
  - Added alt text for images.
  - Included keyboard-navigable UI elements with focus states.
- [ ] **10.4** **Performance Check (Lighthouse)**  
  - Run a local Lighthouse audit to see the initial performance, accessibility, and best practices. 
  - Expect some improvements later when actual data is fetched. For now, aim for good initial results.

### 11. **Sign-Off on Phase 1**

- [ ] **11.1** **Review the UI**  
  - Compare with the old site's design. Confirm it looks/feels similarly user-friendly. 
  - Note any changes or enhancements made.
- [ ] **11.2** **Confirm Completion of Key Tasks**  
  - All mandatory pages exist with placeholder data: Home, Shop, Product Details, Cart, Login, Register, Dashboard placeholder.
  - Header & Footer are consistent, design in place, responsive.
- [ ] **11.3** **Phase 1 Ready**  
  - Merge the final branch into `main`. 
  - Tag the release (e.g., `v1.0.0-frontend-setup`).
  - Deploy to staging or production to begin Phase 2 (Supabase Setup).

✅ Real product data fetching from Supabase (145+ products in database)

**Pending (Remaining Steps 10-11, and parts of Phase 2):**
🔜 Complete testing in Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
🔜 Run Lighthouse performance audit
🔜 Final review and sign-off
🔜 Complete remaining Supabase setup for authentication and user profiles

## Looking Forward

With **Phase 1** now substantially complete and **Phase 2** (Supabase integration) partially implemented, we've created a modern, responsive interface that not only replicates the existing site's functionality but enhances it with superior UX and performance. The frontend is already fetching real product data from Supabase, demonstrating the viability of the architecture.

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete Phase 2 by finishing any remaining Supabase database setup
2. Implement Phase 3 (Supabase Authentication) to enable user registration and login
3. Continue with subsequent phases including Discogs API integration, Stripe payments, and AI recommendations
