Below is a **very detailed, step-by-step plan** specifically for **Phase 1 (Frontend Setup with Next.js)**. Each task is accompanied by checkboxes so that you can track the progress with your developer. The objective of this phase is to establish the foundational front-end structure, replicate/improve upon the existing site's design, and prepare for future integrations. 

---

## Phase 1: Frontend Setup with Next.js

### 1. **Project Initialization & Configuration**

- [✓] **1.1** Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket named, for example, `theshoprecords-frontend`.
- [✓] **1.2** Clone the repository locally:  
  ```bash
  git clone <repo-url>
  cd theshoprecords-frontend
  ```
- [✓] **1.3** Run `npx create-next-app@latest .` to initialize a new Next.js app **within** that directory. 
  - Choose **TypeScript** if desired (recommended for better type-safety).
  - Or select the JavaScript option if you prefer.
  - Confirm the folder is named appropriately (e.g., the existing `.`).
- [✓] **1.4** Confirm the base Next.js structure: a `pages` folder (or `app` folder if using Next.js App Router), and config files like `next.config.js`.
- [✓] **1.5** Install additional dependencies:
  - **UI libraries** (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, or Styled Components). For Tailwind, run:
    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
  - Any other optional dependencies you plan to use for styling or icons (e.g., `@heroicons/react` if you like those icons).

### 2. **Basic Project Setup**

- [✓] **2.1** Configure global styles:
  - If using Tailwind, open `tailwind.config.js` and set up your theme (colors, fonts) as needed. 
  - In `globals.css` (or equivalent), import Tailwind's base, components, and utilities if using Tailwind:
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
- [✓] **2.2** Set up your **site-wide layout**:
  - Create a `components/layouts/MainLayout.tsx` (or `.jsx`) that includes:
    - Header (logo, navigation, search bar)
    - Main content area
    - Footer (copyright, links)
  - Import this layout in your main pages.
  - (If using App Router in Next.js 13, you can do this with a `layout.tsx` file in the `app` directory.)

### 3. **Create Pages & Routes**

1. **3.1** **Home Page** (`/`)
   - [✓] **3.1.1** In `pages/index.tsx`, create a basic component with a placeholder hero section or "Featured Records" section.
   - [✓] **3.1.2** Add a simple placeholder "Featured Items" grid or carousel for demonstration.
   - [✓] **3.1.3** Wrap it in `MainLayout` so the page has the header and footer.

2. **3.2** **Shop/Catalog Page** (`/shop`)
   - [✓] **3.2.1** Create `pages/shop/index.tsx`.
   - [✓] **3.2.2** Add a grid or list layout of product cards (dummy data for now).
   - [✓] **3.2.3** Include pagination or infinite scroll structure if you want (just placeholders for the moment).
   - [✓] **3.2.4** Ensure a search bar or filter panel could be placed here in the future.

3. **3.3** **Product Detail Page** (`/shop/[id]`)
   - [✓] **3.3.1** Create `[id].tsx` or `[slug].tsx` inside `pages/shop`.
   - [✓] **3.3.2** Display a single product detail layout: large cover image, title, artist, price, add-to-cart button, etc.
   - [✓] **3.3.3** Use dummy data for now, e.g., an object containing the product's fields.

4. **3.4** **Cart Page** (`/cart`)
   - [✓] **3.4.1** Create `pages/cart.tsx`.
   - [✓] **3.4.2** Display a list of cart items (dummy array), showing product name, quantity, price, and a total price calculation.
   - [✓] **3.4.3** Include a placeholder "Checkout" button.

5. **3.5** **Auth Pages** (`/login`, `/register`) 
   - [✓] **3.5.1** Create `pages/login.tsx` and `pages/register.tsx` with simple forms. 
   - [✓] **3.5.2** No actual authentication yet (will connect to Supabase in Phase 3), but have the forms structured: email/password fields, a submit button, etc.

6. **3.6** **User Dashboard (Placeholder)** (`/dashboard`)
   - [✓] **3.6.1** Create `pages/dashboard/index.tsx`.
   - [✓] **3.6.2** Protected route (we'll do actual protection in Phase 3), but for now just a placeholder "Welcome [User], here's your dashboard" message.

### 4. **Replicate & Improve Existing Design Elements**

- [✓] **4.1** **Header (Navigation & Search)**  
  - Make sure the layout closely resembles or improves the current site's header, including:
    - Logo on the left or center.
    - Navigation links (Home, Shop, Dashboard, etc.) or a hamburger menu for mobile.
    - A search bar either in the header or as an icon that expands. 
    - Possibly a cart icon showing cart count.

- [✓] **4.2** **Footer**  
  - Re-create or slightly improve the existing footer design:
    - Basic text about TheShopRecords.
    - Social media links or newsletter signup (if the current site has them).
    - Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy links, etc.

- [✓] **4.3** **Typography & Color Scheme**  
  - Ensure fonts and colors are consistent with your existing branding. If the current site uses a particular font, replicate or find a close match via Google Fonts/Typekit.
  - Set up utility classes (if using Tailwind) or theme tokens for brand colors, headings, body text, etc.

- [✓] **4.4** **Responsive Layout**  
  - Test the new layout on mobile sizes. Ensure:
    - Header items stack or collapse into a hamburger menu.
    - Product grids re-flow to 1 or 2 columns on small screens.
    - Cart page is scannable on small devices.
  - Keep checking the design so it feels user-friendly (like your current site) but with small enhancements.

### 5. **Implement Dummy Data & Mock Services**

- [✓] **5.1** **Global State for Products**  
  - Optionally, create a dummy JSON file or JavaScript object with a list of records (artist, title, price, cover URL). This can be used to populate the shop page and product detail pages.
- [✓] **5.2** **Cart State**  
  - Implement a simple React Context or a small state management approach (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or even use React's built-in Context + `useReducer`) to store the cart items.
  - For now, just have an "addToCart(productId)" that pushes the item to a `cartItems` array. 
  - Show the items on the Cart page. This is all local for now; no real backend yet.

### 6. **Navigation & Routing Verification**

- [✓] **6.1** Add a Next.js `<Link>` or a `useRouter` push for main links:
  - Header navigation links to Home (`/`), Shop (`/shop`), Cart (`/cart`).
  - Product card "View Details" linking to `/shop/[id]`.
- [✓] **6.2** Confirm each route works and the layout is consistent across pages.

### 7. **Styling & UI Polishing**

- [✓] **7.1** **Product Cards**  
  - Fine-tune the look of product cards: show cover image in a fixed ratio (like square), overlay or show price, short title, add to cart button, etc.
  - Make sure the card is consistent with the design language (colors, font sizes).
- [✓] **7.2** **Buttons & Forms**  
  - Standardize button styles. Possibly create a `<Button>` component with variants (primary, secondary, etc.).
  - Style the login/register forms to match your brand.
- [✓] **7.3** **Hover & Focus States**  
  - Add subtle hover effects for links, product cards, buttons. 
  - Ensure accessibility for focus states (keyboard navigation).
- [✓] **7.4** **Images**  
  - Use Next.js `<Image>` component for images to leverage image optimization. 
  - For now, you can link to placeholder URLs or local static images to fill in. 
  - Check that images respond to different device sizes properly (responsive breakpoints).

### 8. **SEO & Meta Setup**

- [✓] **8.1** **Head Metadata**  
  - Use the `<Head>` component (or `next/head`) to set page titles and descriptions for Home, Shop, and Product pages. Even if they're placeholders, it's good practice.
- [✓] **8.2** **Basic SEO**  
  - Ensure the homepage has an `h1` with a descriptive heading like "TheShopRecords – Your Place for Vinyl." 
  - Add relevant meta tags (description, keywords, etc.) in `_document` or the individual page.
  - This will help once you go live, even if it's an MVP. 

### 9. **Set Up Version Control & CI/CD (Optional)**

- [ ] **9.1** **Git Commits**  
  - Throughout development, commit frequently with clear messages.
- [ ] **9.2** **Pull Requests & Code Reviews**  
  - If working in a team, ensure the developer creates feature branches and merges via PRs for tracking changes.
- [ ] **9.3** **Continuous Deployment**  
  - If you have a Vercel account or Netlify, connect the repo for automatic deployments. 
  - Every push to `main` or `master` can trigger a new staging build, providing a shareable URL to test the site's progress.
  - This will let you quickly preview the front-end changes.

### 10. **Testing & Final Checks for Phase 1**

- [ ] **10.1** **Browser Testing**  
  - Test in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Check layout, images, navigation flows.
- [ ] **10.2** **Mobile Responsiveness**  
  - Inspect in mobile emulators (Chrome dev tools) or actual devices. Make adjustments for any layout breaks.
- [ ] **10.3** **Basic Accessibility**  
  - Ensure that pages have correct heading structure, alt text for images, and proper color contrast.
- [ ] **10.4** **Performance Check (Lighthouse)**  
  - Run a local Lighthouse audit to see the initial performance, accessibility, and best practices. 
  - Expect some improvements later when actual data is fetched. For now, aim for good initial results.

### 11. **Sign-Off on Phase 1**

- [ ] **11.1** **Review the UI**  
  - Compare with the old site's design. Confirm it looks/feels similarly user-friendly. 
  - Note any changes or enhancements made.
- [ ] **11.2** **Confirm Completion of Key Tasks**  
  - All mandatory pages exist with placeholder data: Home, Shop, Product Details, Cart, Login, Register, Dashboard placeholder.
  - Header & Footer are consistent, design in place, responsive.
- [ ] **11.3** **Phase 1 Ready**  
  - Merge the final branch into `main`. 
  - Tag the release (e.g., `v1.0.0-frontend-setup`).
  - Deploy to staging or production to begin Phase 2 (Supabase Setup).

## Current Status (Phase 1)

**Completed (Steps 1-8):**
✅ All development tasks for creating the frontend structure are complete
✅ All necessary pages and components have been created
✅ Styling and UI elements have been implemented
✅ Navigation and routing is working

**Pending (Steps 9-11):**
🔜 Testing and verification across browsers and device sizes
🔜 Accessibility and performance checks
🔜 Final review and sign-off

## After Phase 1

With this **Phase 1** done, you'll have a fully working **front-end skeleton** that replicates/improves the user experience of the existing site, but using modern Next.js practices. It uses **dummy data** or local state for products and cart. There's no real backend or Supabase integration yet, which will be tackled in future phases.

**Next Steps**:
1. Phase 2 will integrate Supabase for the database and set up the schema.
2. Phase 3 will connect authentication to Supabase.
3. Further phases will handle Discogs API, Stripe payments, AI recommendations, and more.
