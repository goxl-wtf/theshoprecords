# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

## Browser MCP (browser-tools)
You can use the `browser-tools-mcp` server commands to automate browser tasks, such as:
- `getConsoleLogs`  
- `getConsoleErrors`  
- `getNetworkErrors`  
- `getNetworkLogs`  
- `takeScreenshot`  
- `getSelectedElement`  
- `wipeLogs`  

### Example usage:
You might call the `takeScreenshot` tool to capture the current browser viewport if you need a visual reference of your website. Or use `getConsoleLogs` to debug any messages in the browser console.

## GitHub MCP (github-mcp)
Use this server to manage GitHub operations, such as:
- `create_or_update_file`
- `search_repositories`
- `create_repository`
- `get_file_contents`
- `push_files`
- `create_issue`
- `create_pull_request`
- `fork_repository`
- `create_branch`
- `list_commits`
- `list_issues`
- `update_issue`
- `add_issue_comment`
- `search_code`
- `search_issues`
- `search_users`
- `get_issue`

### Example usage:
- Run `create_or_update_file` to commit new or changed files to the repository.
- Use `create_pull_request` to open a new PR from a branch to `main`.
- Manage issues via `create_issue` or `add_issue_comment`.

## Supabase MCP (supabase)
Use this server to interact with the Supabase PostgreSQL database:
- `query` - Run SQL queries against the Supabase database
  
### Example usage:
- Use `query` to check the database schema or retrieve data directly from tables

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.  
  (**Note**: This may not be strictly necessary now that you rely on MCP, but we preserve it as previously stated.)
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When searching for recent news, use the current year (2025) instead of previous years, or simply use the "recent" keyword to get the latest information
- [New Lesson] For Next.js projects, keep your tasks and sub-tasks well-organized in the Scratchpad to track progress (e.g., `[X]`, `[ ]`).
- [New Lesson] The `browser-tools-mcp` and `github-mcp` can replace previous Python scripts for screenshots, debugging, or GitHub tasks.
- [New Lesson] When initializing a Next.js project in an existing directory, using temporary solution like creating in a sibling directory and copying files might be easier than forcing the installation.
- [New Lesson] When refactoring components in Next.js, start by identifying clear UI boundaries, creating properly typed interfaces, and extracting from the largest components first.
- [New Lesson] When creating hover effects, use Tailwind's group and group-hover classes to create coordinated animations and interactive elements.
- [New Lesson] For Supabase integration, create a robust utility function like getSupabase() that includes error handling for more reliable database access.
- [New Lesson] When refactoring a large page into components, organize them in logical feature folders (e.g., `/components/productPage/`) with proper index files to simplify imports.
- [New Lesson] Client-side hooks like `useSearchParams()` in Next.js must be wrapped in a Suspense boundary to prevent build errors. Extract the component using these hooks into a separate client component and wrap it in a Suspense boundary.
- [New Lesson] In Next.js, avoid duplicate route definitions (like having both /login and /auth/login). Instead, use redirects or route groups (parentheses notation) to organize code without affecting URL paths.
- [New Lesson] When using console debugging in React components, be aware that in development mode, React may mount components multiple times. Use a singleton pattern or conditional logging to prevent console spam.
- [New Lesson] For Next.js Image component with external images, ensure the domains are properly configured in next.config.js with remotePatterns.
