# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.  
  (**Note**: This may not be strictly necessary now that you rely on MCP, but we preserve it as previously stated.)
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When searching for recent news, use the current year (2025) instead of previous years, or simply use the "recent" keyword to get the latest information
- [New Lesson] For Next.js projects, keep your tasks and sub-tasks well-organized in the Scratchpad to track progress (e.g., `[X]`, `[ ]`).
- [New Lesson] The `browser-tools-mcp` and `github-mcp` can replace previous Python scripts for screenshots, debugging, or GitHub tasks.
- [New Lesson] When initializing a Next.js project in an existing directory, using temporary solution like creating in a sibling directory and copying files might be easier than forcing the installation.
- [New Lesson] When refactoring components in Next.js, start by identifying clear UI boundaries, creating properly typed interfaces, and extracting from the largest components first.
- [New Lesson] When creating hover effects, use Tailwind's group and group-hover classes to create coordinated animations and interactive elements.
- [New Lesson] For Supabase integration, create a robust utility function like getSupabase() that includes error handling for more reliable database access.
- [New Lesson] When refactoring a large page into components, organize them in logical feature folders (e.g., `/components/productPage/`) with proper index files to simplify imports.
- [New Lesson] Client-side hooks like `useSearchParams()` in Next.js must be wrapped in a Suspense boundary to prevent build errors. Extract the component using these hooks into a separate client component and wrap it in a Suspense boundary.
- [New Lesson] In Next.js, avoid duplicate route definitions (like having both /login and /auth/login). Instead, use redirects or route groups (parentheses notation) to organize code without affecting URL paths.
- [New Lesson] When using console debugging in React components, be aware that in development mode, React may mount components multiple times. Use a singleton pattern or conditional logging to prevent console spam.
- [New Lesson] For Next.js Image component with external images, ensure the domains are properly configured in next.config.js with remotePatterns.
- [New Lesson] When creating component hierarchies, ensure proper index.ts files are created for each directory to simplify imports. Export components consistently (either named or default exports) to avoid type errors.
- [New Lesson] When refactoring existing components, consider maintaining backward compatibility by re-exporting the new component with the old name when used in many places.
- [New Lesson] For search functionality, implementing autocomplete dropdown with keyboard navigation provides a better user experience than simple live filtering.
- [New Lesson] Avoid nesting layouts in Next.js applications. When using a root layout with header/footer, don't wrap page components with additional layout components that include the same elements to prevent duplication.
- [New Lesson] When implementing analytics dashboards in Next.js/React, use Chart.js with react-chartjs-2 for data visualization and implement proper state management for filters. Also ensure dashboard components have proper loading, error, and empty states to handle all possible data scenarios.
- [New Lesson] Always add validation for UI components that handle numeric values. When working with sliders, ranges, or other numeric inputs, defend against NaN, undefined, and null values by providing safe fallbacks and explicit type conversion to avoid React DOM attribute errors.
- [New Lesson] When implementing marketplace functionality in e-commerce applications, ensure proper validation of database schema relationships before deploying features. Using scripts to check table and column existence can help identify issues early. Always provide fallback behavior in components when database schema might not be complete yet.
- [New Lesson] In Supabase projects, when tables have non-standard primary keys (like `seller_profiles` using `user_id` instead of `id`), explicitly define foreign key relationships with the correct column references. When foreign keys can't be defined or are missing, implement manual join fallbacks that use multiple queries and in-memory joins to ensure application resilience.
- [New Lesson] In Next.js API routes that use Supabase cookies, always properly await the cookies() function and use createRouteHandlerClient with awaited cookies to avoid "sync-dynamic-apis" errors.
- [New Lesson] When using Supabase's createRouteHandlerClient in Next.js API routes, pass the cookies function directly as `createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies })` rather than wrapping it in an anonymous function like `createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies: () => cookieStore })` to avoid the "Route used cookies().set()" error.
- [New Lesson] For Next.js 15+ compatibility with Supabase authentication, use the `@supabase/ssr` package instead of `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`. The auth-helpers package is deprecated and doesn't support Next.js 15's asynchronous cookies API. Use `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` with `await cookies()` in route handlers.
- [New Lesson] When implementing login functionality with Supabase in Next.js, always refresh the session with supabase.auth.getSession() after successful authentication API responses, and update the user state manually. Don't rely solely on the auth state change event, which may not trigger properly in some scenarios.
- [New Lesson] When using Supabase authentication, remember that user creation in auth.users doesn't automatically create a record in your application's custom users table. Implement logic to handle this case by creating a basic user record in your custom users table when auth succeeds but the user doesn't exist in your database. This prevents "No rows returned" errors when fetching user profiles after authentication.
- [New Lesson] When implementing custom user tables with Supabase authentication, ensure your database schema is properly defined. For example, if your users table requires an auth_id field, make sure this is included when creating user records. Also, handle role-specific tables (like seller_profiles) by adding logic to create these records when appropriate.

# Previous Task: Fixing Application Errors

## Error Analysis

The application is experiencing several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Order Fetch Error**: 
   - Error message: "Failed to fetch orders" in orders page
   - Error location: app/user/orders/page.tsx:61
   - Possible causes: API endpoint failure, cookie handling, or database schema issue

2. **Cookies API Usage**:
   - Error message: "Route used `cookies().get()`. `cookies()` should be awaited before using its value."
   - Affected endpoints: /api/user/orders, /api/auth/login
   - This needs proper async cookie handling

3. **Database Schema Issue**:
   - Error message: "column products_2.slug does not exist"
   - This indicates a SQL query problem in the order fetching logic
   - Either the column doesn't exist or there's a join issue in the query

4. **Dashboard UI Issues**:
   - The seller dashboard should have different functionality than the user dashboard
   - Currently both are showing the same UI

5. **Login Redirection Issue**:
   - User successfully logs in but doesn't get redirected to the dashboard
   - The user state is not being properly updated after login
   - The redirect logic isn't properly triggered

## Implementation Progress

   [X] 2.1.2 Identify the SQL query in the orders API that's causing the error
   [X] 2.1.3 Fix the column reference by removing the slug column from the query

### 3. Order Fetching Logic
[X] 3.1 Examine the orders page client-side code
   [X] 3.1.1 Find the fetchOrders function at line 61
   [X] 3.1.2 Fix error handling and add better debugging
   [X] 3.1.3 Ensure proper data fetching patterns are used

### 4. Dashboard Differentiation
[X] 4.1 Create separate dashboard views for sellers and regular users
   [X] 4.1.1 Identify what functionality sellers need (listing management, sales data)
   [X] 4.1.2 Update dashboard to conditionally render different components based on user type
   [X] 4.1.3 Create seller-specific components if needed

### 5. Login Redirection Issue
[X] 5.1 Fix the user authentication flow

   [X] 6.1.1 Add logic to detect when a user exists in Supabase auth but not in the custom users table
   [X] 6.1.2 Create a basic user record in the database when this situation is detected
   [X] 6.1.3 Update UserContext to handle this scenario gracefully

## Summary of Fixes

1. **API Routes Cookies Issue**:
   - Fixed async cookie handling in all API routes
   - Upgraded from deprecated auth-helpers-nextjs to @supabase/ssr for better Next.js 15 compatibility
   - Improved error handling and debugging throughout the auth flow

2. **Database Schema Issue**:
   - Fixed the SQL query in the orders API to properly handle product slugs
   - Added comprehensive debugging to identify schema-related issues

3. **Order Fetching Logic**:
   - Enhanced error handling in the orders page
   - Added detailed logging for better debugging
   - Fixed type errors and improved state management

4. **Dashboard Differentiation**:
   - Ensured dashboard properly shows different content for sellers vs regular users
   - Added proper type checking for user properties
   - Improved conditional rendering logic

5. **Login Redirection Issue**:
   - Fixed user session handling in UserContext
   - Ensured proper redirection after successful login
   - Added better error handling throughout the auth flow

6. **User Record Creation**:

1. Data model and validation
2. Product display with seller information
3. Cart and checkout with multi-seller support
4. Filtering and sorting for marketplace listings
5. Seller dashboard with analytics

## Initial Investigation Findings
After investigating the codebase and database schema, we've identified the following issues:

1. **Database Schema Issues**:
   - The 'listing_images' table is missing, causing API errors
   - The 'seller_orders' table is missing
   - The 'seller_profiles' table exists but is missing expected columns like store_name, description, etc.
   - The relationship between 'listings' and 'seller_profiles' is not properly set up
   - No users in the database, which prevents seller profile creation
   - The migration script fails due to missing database functions

2. **Browser Console Errors**:
   - ✅ Fixed: NaN values for min, max, and value attributes in price range slider (by adding validation)
   - Errors with listing_images relationship causing API failures
   - Specific error: "column users_1.store_name does not exist" when trying to query seller information

3. **Code Adjustments Made**:
   - ✅ Updated marketplaceService.ts to avoid using the missing listing_images relationship
   - ✅ Updated the product detail page to handle the case where no listings are found
   - ✅ Created test scripts that can work with mock data to verify component functionality
   - ✅ Fixed: PriceRangeSlider component to safely handle NaN values
